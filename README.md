<p>I have built a Supervised Learning Classification model to predict the probabilty of diabetis given age and physical activity data.  Will be using Python to feed data into my Machine Learning model to obtain my diabetes prediction.</p>

download_data(x) - reads a URL and returns dataframe
write_data(data, directory, **kwargs) - reads dictionary of dataframes and directory path.  writes each dataframe as a csv to the path on my local drive
read_local_data(name, directory) - reads partial file name and directory.  returns 1 csv and return a csv
run() - I defined a list of names and a empty dictionary. Loop thru the name and in each interation,  Call method read_local_data(name, path). add the csv it return to the dictionary.  when done, return the entire dictonary
select_columns(df) - defines a list with  fewer column names.  Read in dataframe  Returns dataframe with only the columns in list
run2() - includes everything from run() but added select_columns(df)
update_labels(df) - Went thru my Feature Engineering.ipynb and extracted all cells that updated columns name and added them here.  Input dataframe.  Return dataframe with updated columns names
run3() - includes everything from run2() but added update_labels(df)
group_data(df,x,y) - read dataframe. returns table. idendified a good chart i wanted to pull in my dashbarod.  Covert it to dataframe output using Gemini(AI).  added code here.  Added parameters for x and y
run4() - includes everything from run3() but added group_data(df,"GeneralHealth","Type")
run5() - includes everything from run3() but added group_data(df,"income","Type")
run6() - includes everything from run3() but added group_data(df,"education","Type")
Testing all functions at the bottm in the Feature_Engineering.ipynb
Saved all methods/functions to a file  called my_functions.ipynb
in juypter notebook saved prepared_cdc.ipynb as my_functions.py. Now, my file is a module.  Then I added class PreparedData_CDC to add all my methods to this class</td>
